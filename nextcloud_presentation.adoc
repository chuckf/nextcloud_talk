== Presentation Notes

This presentation is not a replacement for the detailed instructions from {nex}.
Downloads and documentation are available at https://nextcloud.com/install

For the {nex} server installation we'll talk about and install {nex} {nexv}
// ** We'll be using the {nexzip} file

The demo system is running CentOS 7.3 with the following installed and configured:

* Apache webserver
* PHP 7 (5.6 or higher is required for {nex} 11.x and higher)
** Required php modules
* MariaDB
* Firewall ports 80 and 443 opened

(See the appendix for details )

== Server Installation

. Download the {nexzip} file from the {nex} site.
. Unzip the downloaded file using the command `unzip {nexzip} -d /var/www/html/`
.. The files will be extracted to /var/www/html/nextcloud
. Create or know the path to the data directory.
For this example we will create and use `/var/www/html/nextcloud/data` (but is not recommended for production)
. Change ownership of the Nextcloud directories to the web user and group with the command `chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/nextcloud`
. Modify the selinux permissions of the directories (see appendix)
. Navigate to the server with your web browser `\https://<host or ip>/nextcloud` to complete the Installation Wizard
